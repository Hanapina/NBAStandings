## Small Scraper ##

Scrapes Basketball Reference for certain team stats.

Do not constantly spam open the executable when it first runs or you can rate limit yourself. 

The program creates 2 files to be read: **easternConf.txt** and **westerConf.txt** so make sure those are not deleted. 

Manually update stats if you need to (also do not spam this). 

Any potential spamming can lead to you getting rate-limited and thus being unable to pull from the basketball reference site.
